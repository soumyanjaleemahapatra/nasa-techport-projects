        "description": "<p>Onboard autonomy is needed for safe autonomous Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) flight operations to keep aircraft from colliding with each other and buildings. Despite decades of Sense and Avoid research in the aviation domain, the specific requirements from an aviation authority for widespread autonomous operations for small aircraft and small Unmanned Aircraft Systems (sUAS) does not exist. AAM researchers need to provide reproducible methodologies for developing collision avoidance systems. One promising sensor for Sense and Avoid systems is the camera as it is lightweight, data rich, and can provide high angular resolution of objects. In this work, we present a vision dataset collected from multirotor sUAS and fixed-wing sUAS where the targets include multirotor sUAS, fixed-wing sUAS, General Aviation aircraft, and birds captured over seven days with varying flight conditions through thirty-one videos. A novel semi-autonomous data labeling technique is presented utilizing an object detection and tracking pipeline. The dataset includes onboard flight controller logs along with the computed separation distance between the ownship and intruder aircraft per frame.</p> ",

The program&rsquo;s goal is to knock down technical barriers and infuse internally and externally originated concepts into all six strategic thrusts identified by ARMD, creating innovation for tomorrow in the aviation system. Using sharply focused activities, the program provides flexibility for innovators to explore technology feasibility and provide the knowledge base for radical transformation. The program solicits and encourages revolutionary concepts, creates the environment for researchers to become immersed in trying out new ideas, performs ground and small-scale flight tests, allows failures and learns from them, and drives rapid turnover into new concepts.&nbsp; The TAC Program also explores technologies that are broadly-critical to advancing aviation.&nbsp; Further, it places attention on computational and experimental tools that are critical for supporting development and enabling aviation transformation by investing in never-done-before developments that can provide paradigm-shifting analysis and experimental capability.</p> <p>The Transformative Aeronautics Concepts Program cultivates multi-disciplinary, revolutionary concepts to enable aviation transformation with a goal to knock down technical barriers and infuse internally and externally originated concepts into all six ARMD strategic research thrusts.</p> <p>The work in the Transformative Aeronautics Concepts Program directly benefits the public by bringing game-changing advances in other fields to solve aviation&#39;s global challenges of energy and sustainability.&nbsp;&nbsp;It explores concepts that can be applied across the NASA ARMD research portfolio.&nbsp; The TACP is an incubator for short-term explorations of innovative ideas that could lead to radical transformation for aviation. It solicits and encourages revolutionary concepts and, most important, creates an environment in which researchers can become immersed in trying out new ideas. It performs ground and small-scale flight tests that allow for failure, for learning from failure, and for rapidly driving on to new approaches.&nbsp; TACP also advances the state of the art in tools for simulation and modeling that can accurately predict the performance of revolutionary aircraft shapes or methods of propulsion. It drives advances in technologies that will enable aviation concepts.&nbsp;&nbsp;TACP exists to solicit and converge ideas from diverse thinkers.</p>",
